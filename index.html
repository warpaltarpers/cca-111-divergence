	<h5>video game designer, screenwriter, director, and game producer</h5>
	<p>A critically-acclaimed video game design legend known for the <i>Metal Gear</i> series, <b>Hideo Kojima</b> is the founder of <a href="http://www.kojimaproductions.jp/" target="_blank">Kojima Productions</a>.</p>

	<h3>Divergence <small>and Kojima</small></h3>
	<p>On March 19, an anonymous employee reported to GameSpot that these changes were a result of conflicts between Kojima and Konami. The employee stated that Kojima and
	his staff were now being treated as contracted workers rather than employees, Konami had blocked access to their corporate e-mail and phone systems (thus restricting their communications),
	and that Kojima and the studio's senior staff planned to leave Konami in December 2015 following the conclusion of their contracts and the release of <i>The Phantom Pain</i>.<sup><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-expected-to-leave-konami-after-mgs5-inside-/1100-6426024/" target="_blank">1</a></sup></p>

	<p>Kojima Productions is now working on a new game for the PlayStation 4, their first after separating from Konami. <i>Death Stranding</i> does not have a release day slated, but actors <b>Norman Reedus</b>,
